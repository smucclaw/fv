#+TITLE: Formalisation in Nunchaku

Nunchaku is a prover / counter example generator for first and higher-order
logic. It is a stand-alone successor of the Nitpick system that is used in the
Isabelle theorem prover as counter example generator.

The system description is available here:
https://nunchaku-inria.github.io/nunchaku/

Installation is a bit complex and lengthy as Nunchaku is written in Caml and
can best be installed via Caml's package manager opam. So the best steps are:

- install opam as described here: http://opam.ocaml.org/
- install Nunchaku as described here:
  https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku#install
- for running Nunchaku in a new directory, run =eval `opam config env`= to
  update the environment variables.

After installation, just invoke the model finder with something like =nunchaku
