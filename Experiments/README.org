#+TITLE: Experiments with formal verification with different tools

- Alloy: A model checker for exploring structural properties (relations
  between persons etc.). No arithmetic reasoning, no direct temporal reasoning
  (the latter could be coded for qualitative but not quantitative timing). 
- Uppaal: a temporal model checker (quantitative timing). 
- ProfessionalConductRule34: This is not a tool properly speaking, but an
  attempt to represent Section 34 of the Professional Conduct Rules in
  different formalisms.
