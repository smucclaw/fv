Notation:

FG automaton / contract: in the Flood-Goodenough paper

General remarks:

* In the Uppaal formalisation, activities have been named with verbs and
  states with nouns.

* Some redundancies in the FG automaton: for each default of payment, 5 states
  are duplicated (including "Payment (1/2) accruing", which is anyway an
  artifact). Only difference: loop back "General default cured" for Payment
  accruing 1, missing in 2. Why? 

* The global FG automaton contains irrelevant details about reasons of
  default, at least as far as the lender is concerned. 


Difference between written contract and automaton:

* FG automaton: The states Start and Active_contract are not explicit in the
  written text. Neither are Payment (1/2) accruing. In fact, most part of the
  automaton has nothing to do with the written text (states about default
  behavior). 

* Written:
  Sec. 1: "If Borrower does not make such a request, this agreement will
  terminate." After which time? This is not represented in automaton.

* Written: Sec. 7 - 11 not represented in automaton

Pitfalls / potential "errors" in the contract:

* Potential infinite loop around Payment 1 accruing, with deadlock if past
  1/6/2015.
